Hey there,
three weeks ago, i got massage from the reserve that they need me for three 
weeks of "תעסוקה מבצעית", i tried to talk to all of the commandors, but its the IDF, 
there's no one to talk to. I packed my stuff and almost ruined my semester (it's
the seconde time they call me in that semester)... 
after 8 days of asking, they let me go, but i had so many holes in all of the courses.
I worked hard in the last days to finish this assignment, but i didn't have enough time
to finish the 'det()' function.
Hope youll take it in consideration, with the auto testers, and all of it...
Thank you so much. 
all the best,
Omer Rom.
